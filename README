This is another simple weblog app. I think I've written about 10 different ones over the years. Will this be the last? I doubt it.

I'm writing this one to get a better grasp on:

* Sinatra.rb <http://www.sinatrarb.com/>
* Haml <http://haml-lang.com/>
* Sass <http://sass-lang.com/>
* Datamapper <http://datamapper.org/doku.php>

We'll see how it goes.

TODO (besides the obvious):

* Have config/database.rb create the database itself if not available
