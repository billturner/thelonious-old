This is another simple weblog app. I think I've written about 10 different ones over the years. Will this be the last? I doubt it.

I'm writing this one to get a better grasp on:

* Sinatra.rb <http://www.sinatrarb.com/>
* Haml <http://haml-lang.com/>
* Sass <http://sass-lang.com/>
* Datamapper <http://datamapper.org/doku.php>

We'll see how it goes.

SETTING IT UP:

1. Grab the code from Github
2. Move/copy config/database.db.sample => config/database.rb 
3. Fill in your DB credentials (host, user, pass, DB)
4. Create the DB if it does not already exist
5. Run "rake app:setup_files" to copy the base files live
6. a few more steps here..

TODO:

* Caching (esp. RSS & sitemap)
* constraints/validations on posts/pages - errors (flash?)
* Fix the checkbox (published for Post)
* write some tests
